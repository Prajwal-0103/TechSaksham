#  Personal Fitness Tracker

##  Overview  
This is a web application that predicts **calories burned** based on user input parameters such as age, gender, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The application uses **machine learning (Random Forest Regressor)** to make accurate predictions based on exercise and calorie data.

---

##  Features  
-  Interactive user interface with sliders for inputting personal parameters  
-  Real-time prediction of calories burned during exercise  
-  Comparison with similar results from the dataset  
-  Statistical comparison with other people in the dataset  

---

##  Technologies Used  
- **Streamlit**: For the web application interface  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization  

---

##  Dataset  
The application uses two datasets:  
- `calories.csv`: Contains calorie information for each user  
- `exercise.csv`: Contains exercise parameters including gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature
